SFWify
======
Notice: [FA is officially developing a filtering system.](https://furaffinity.net/journal/9761295) This add-on is now officially depreciated.

Edit: FurAffinity's ratelimit can now be bypassed with [https://furaffinity-ratelimit.akona.me/](https://furaffinity-ratelimit.akona.me/). Find out how it works on my blog.

Browser addon that prevents submissions meeting an user criteria from appearing on the Furaffinity home, browse, or search pages.

Screw the inflation / diaper / feet porn!

Issues
------
-	~~SFWify may behave slowly to avoid triggering Furaffinity's (possibly anti-DDoS) rate limit system. A fix is being worked on. Right now using prefetch and waiting helps.~~
-	Some users improperly tag or provide no tags to their submissions. Try blocking that user.
-	buggy
